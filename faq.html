					<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
				</header>
				<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
				<p>Annual dues are currently $175 per Scout. This number may change depending on Pack expenses and fundraising results in a given year. The full uniform costs around $150, but the required pieces cost $90. Handbooks are provided by the Pack.<br>
				<div>
					<p>Required Uniform:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scout shirt</li>
						<li>Rank specific neckerchief and slide</li>
						<li>Patches: council shoulder, pack numerals, world crest and ring</li>
						<li>Belt</li>
						<li>Jeans</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Additional Optional Uniform Items:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scout pants</li>
						<li>Scout socks</li>
						<li>Rank specific hat</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h2>What is the time commitment? How often do you meet?</h2>
				<p>In a typical month, the Scouts meet twice. The Den meeting is the first Thursday of the month. In this meeting, the Pack will break up into Dens to work on rank achievements as planned by the Den Leader. <br>The Pack Meeting is the third Thursday of the month. In this meeting, the whole Pack meets for a group activity or guest, with awards and achievements recognized. Some of our events replace the Pack meeting for a given month (Pinewood Derby, Rocket Launch, Campout, etc.) Each meeting is kept to under an hour and a half, and starts at 6:30pm. Special events can run longer, and are typically earlier in the day.</p>
				<h2>What if we can’t make all the Den Meetings?</h2>
				<p>That's okay! If you can’t make it to a Den meeting you are free to work on the skills/achievements the Den did on your own.  A Scout only needs an Akela to complete requirements.  In Cub Scouts, Akela is anyone who acts as a leader to a Scout: Cubmaster, Den Leader, parent, teacher, coach, etc.</p>
				</p>
				<h2>What calendar do you follow?</h2>
				<p>We follow the School Year.  We start up our program in September and we graduate our Cub Scouts to the next rank in May. During the summer months, we try to meet up for small outdoor activities.</p>
				<h2>Is Pack 747 just for boys?</h2>
				<p>No! Pack 747 can accommodate Dens for different genders. Each gender will be in their own Den, with a same-gendered Den leader.</p>
				<h2>Do I have to wait until join night to join?</h2>
				<p>Not at all! We are happy to welcome new (or relocating) Scouts anytime throughout the year. Contact our Cubmaster for more information on how to join or transfer!</p>
				<h2>How is Cub Scouts different then Boy Scouts?</h2>
				<p>Cub Scouts is the program run by the Boy Scouts of America for kindergarten through 5th grade (ages 5-10). Scouts BSA is the program for ages 11-17. Cub Scout leadership is adult-led, while many Scout BSA Troops are Scout-led. After completing Cub Scouts, many Scouts cross over into a Scouts BSA Troop to continue their Scouting adventure!</p>
				<h2>What are Packs? What are Dens? What's with all the animal names?</h2>
				<p><b>Pack:</b> The entire group of Scouts (kids) and Scouters (adults). This is equivalent to a Scouts BSA Troop. Each Pack is a self-contained unit and makes their own decisions regarding their program within the guidelines of Boy Scouts of America. The Pack is affiliated with a charter organization, in our case, Pinecrest Community Church.<br>
				<b>Den:</b> A Den is a group of Scouts composed of the same school grade level and gender. There may be multiple Dens per grade level depending on number of Scouts and their genders. Each Den has a Den Leader, and at least two adults present at all times.<br>
				<b>Ranks:</b> The Cub Scout ranks are earned by grade level, and the Dens work toward the following ranks for the school year:
				<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Lion - Kindergarten<br>
				Tiger - 1st Grade<br>
				Wolf - 2nd Grade<br>
				Bear - 3rd Grade<br>
				Webelos - 4th Grade<br>
				Arrow of Light (AOL) - 5th Grade</p></p>
				<h2>How does the Pack keep Scouts safe?</h2>
				<p>All registered adult leaders (including all Den Leaders, Cubmaster, etc.) must take BSA's Youth Protection Training. Some of the most important rules provided by this training are parents being required to attend all events (including Pack and Den meetings) for Lions and Tigers, and two deep leadership. Two deep leadership means that at no time should a child be alone with an adult that isn't their parent. Additionally, one of the two leaders will be the same gender as the child. This extends to any online activity as well. Parents are welcome at all events. Pack 747 takes the safety of our Scouts very seriously, and all BSA registered adults are mandatory reporters under Federal law. For more information, please see the BSA's page on <a href="https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/gss01/">Youth Protection</a> or contact our Cubmaster.</p>
